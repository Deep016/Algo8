Analyzing Wine Quality dataset. Explore features, relationships, &amp; key factors influencing wine quality. Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn. [Deepanshu]
Description:

This project is an in-depth analysis of the Wine Quality dataset, which contains information about white wines, including various chemical properties and quality ratings. The objective of this project is to explore the dataset, gain insights into wine quality, and identify the most important factors influencing it.

Features:

Data Loading and Cleaning: We load the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and perform initial data checks, ensuring data integrity. No missing values are detected, making it a clean dataset.

Distribution of Wine Quality Scores: We visualize the distribution of wine quality ratings, revealing that ratings range from 3 to 9, with certain ratings being more common than others.

Relationships Between Features and Wine Quality: We explore relationships between features and wine quality. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between alcohol content and wine quality, finding a positive correlation.

Correlation Heatmap: We create a heatmap to visualize correlations between all features, helping identify which features are more strongly correlated with wine quality.

Feature Importance Analysis: Using a Random Forest Classifier, we determine the most important factors affecting wine quality. Feature importances are visualized to provide a clear understanding of each feature's impact.

Classification Report: We assess the model's performance by generating a classification report, evaluating its ability to predict wine quality.

This project serves as a foundation for understanding wine quality and can be extended for further analysis or integrated into a larger data science project related to wine quality prediction or recommendation.
